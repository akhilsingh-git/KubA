Devops Engineer Assignment

Assignment Title: Kubernetes Deployment and Scaling Project

Assignment Description:
As a DevOps Engineer, your task is to design and implement a Kubernetes deployment and scaling
solution for a web application. The goal of this assignment is to showcase your knowledge and skills
in deploying and managing applications using Kubernetes.
You have been given a web application codebase and your task is to create a Kubernetes deployment
that can effectively run and scale the application. The web application consists of a frontend
component and a backend component, both of which need to be containerized and deployed using
Kubernetes.

Assignment Objectives:
1. Containerize the web application:
a. Create Dockerfiles for both the frontend and backend components of the web application.
b. Build Docker images for each component.

2. Design Kubernetes deployment:
a. Create Kubernetes deployment manifests for the frontend and backend components.
b. Configure appropriate resource limits and requests for each component.
c. Define the required environment variables for the components.
d. Ensure proper logging and monitoring configurations.

3. Implement Kubernetes service:
a. Create a Kubernetes service to expose the frontend component.
b. Ensure the service is accessible within the cluster.

4. Configure application scaling:
a. Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) for the backend component based on CPU
utilisation.
b. Define the minimum and maximum number of replicas for the backend component.

5. Deployment and testing:
a. Deploy the web application using the Kubernetes deployment manifests.
b. Verify that the frontend and backend components are running successfully.
c. Perform load testing on the application and observe the scaling behavior of the backend
component.

Deliverables:
1. Dockerfiles for both the frontend and backend components.
2. Kubernetes deployment manifests for the frontend and backend components.
3. Kubernetes service manifest for the frontend component.
4. A document describing the steps to deploy and scale the web application using Kubernetes.
5. Any additional scripts or configuration files required for the deployment.

Submission Guidelines:
1. Submit all the deliverables in a compressed file (e.g., ZIP or tarball) to the provided email address.
2. Include clear instructions on how to deploy and test the application.
3. Mention any assumptions or considerations made during the implementation.
4. Ensure the submission is done before the deadline specified (3 days from the start of the
assignment).
Note: You are free to make any reasonable assumptions regarding the application requirements,
infrastructure, or any other necessary configurations.

Note :
Kindly use tools like terraform , prometheus and grafana
Also Get it ready to deploy it on aws
